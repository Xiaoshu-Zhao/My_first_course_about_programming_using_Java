Section 1:  TRUE / FALSE  1 pt each


1)  When you extend a class you are required to write a constructor.
	
2)  By using the keyword super you can invoke a method that resides in your parent's class

3)  You can extend multiple classes - i.e. your new class can have multiple immediate parents

4)  You can implement multiple interfaces.

5)  You can declare all your constuctors as private.

6)  Polymorphism means wherever a reference (non primitive) type is expected I can use an object of the same type or its parent type.

7)  Polymorphism means anywhere any primitive is expected I can use any object type and it will automatically and convert between any type to any type.

8)  All classes have Object (capital "O") type as thier ancestor.

9)  The search operation on a HashSet is faster than a search into an unsorted array. 

10)  The search operation on a HashSet is faster than a search into an sorted array. 

11)  The search for an element in a TreeSet is faster that a search on a sorted array.

12) When you pass a reference variable into a method, you cannot change the actual value inside that ref var because you were just passing a copy of the value.

1) What is the difference betwen deep and shallow copy?    

2) What benefits does inheritence bring to a Java programmer programmer?  
	
3) Why should the data members of a class be private instead of public?   
	
4) Name one difference between a checked and an unchecked exception.      

5) Name a Java class (class, not interface) that is good for representing members of a group and doing matematical 
operations such as membership, intersection or union.                     
		
6) Why does TreeSet insist that any type you put into it implements Comparable?
